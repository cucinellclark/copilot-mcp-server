      "content": "This is a service for supervised extraction and annotation of high-quality, near-complete genomes from reads or metagenomically-derived contigs [1]. Reads are assembled using either MetaSPAdes [2] or MEGAHIT [3]. Each set of binned contigs represents a draft genome that will be annotated by RASTtk [4] for bacteria, or with VIGOR4 [5,6] or Mat_Peptide [7] for viruses. A structured-language binning report is provided containing quality measurements and taxonomic information about the contig bins. The BV-BRC metagenome binning service emphasizes extraction of high-quality genomes for downstream analysis using other BV-BRC tools and services.\n\n\nMetagenomic binning jobs that include assembly take, on average, take an hour to complete. However, the BV-BRC assembly service is quite popular, and there is often a long queue resulting in jobs taking 24 hours to complete. If the size of the read file is large (Gb) or the queue is long, results could take several days.\n\nThe code for the binning script is located at: [https://github.com/SEEDtk/p3_code/blob/master/scripts/p3x-process-checkv.pl](https://github.com/SEEDtk/p3_code/blob/master/scripts/p3x-process-checkv.pl)\n\nThe code for the RASTtk pipeline is located at: [https://github.com/SEEDtk/p3_code/blob/master/scripts/p3x-process-bins_generate.pl](https://github.com/SEEDtk/p3_code/blob/master/scripts/p3x-process-bins_generate.pl)\n\n## Locating the Metagenomic Binning Service App\n\n1. At the top of any BV-BRC page, clicking on the **Tools & Services** tab. Click on **Metagenomic Binning** in the drop-down box, underneath **Metagenomics**.\n\n3. This will open up the Metagenomic Binning Service landing page. ",
